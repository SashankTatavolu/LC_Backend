Geo_nios_2ch_0290	We must remember that the weathered material ( i.e. disintegrated and decomposed ) lie in situ ( i.e. at its original position ) .																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0291	In this process no transportation or movement of material is involved other than its falling down under the force of gravity.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0292a	When the rocks are broken up into smaller fragments without any chemical change in their composition																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0292b	, it is called physical weathering.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0293	The term mechanical weathering is also used for physical weathering.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0294	Physical weathering takes place in different ways in different types of areas.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0295	They have been explained here with examples.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0296	We all know that the successive heating and cooling causes expansion and contraction of the rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0297	In hot desert regions , day temperatures are very high.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0298	while nights are very cold.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0299	This high diurnal range of temperature causes successive expansion and contraction of the rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0300	Rocks tend to enlarge the joints.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0301	Finally the rocks disintegrate into smaller blocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0302	This process is known as block disintegration.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0303	Rocks are generally poor conductors of heat.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0304	As a result of intense heating the outer layers of the rock expand rapidly.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0305	The inner layers remain almost unaffected by heat.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0306	Due to successive expansion and contraction , the outer layer of the rock subsequently peels off from the main mass of the rock in the form of concentric shells.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0307	The peeling of rocks in layers by this process is very similar to the peeling of successive layers of an onion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0308	The process is called exfoliation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0309	Almost all rounded forms of dolerite blocks of rocks in Singhbhum district of Bihar are due to this process.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0310	Granite domes of Mahabalipuram , particularly ‘Krishna Ka Laddu’ and those near Jabalpur on Madan Mahal Hill are good examples , of exfoliation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0311a	One of the most important physical weathering processes in cold climates is frost action																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0311b	, the alternate freezing and melting of water inside the joints of the rocks , splits them into fragments.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0312	This is because conversion of water into ice increases the volume of water by 10 percent.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0313	In cold regions rocks are disintegrated into small particles through this process.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0314	It is called frost action.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0315	Disintegration of rocks into smaller fragments without any change in their chemical composition is called mechanical weathering.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0316	The rapid heating and cooling of the rocks creates a series of joints and cracks .

Geo_nios_2ch_0330	Greatest impact of this process is observed on ferrous minerals.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0331	Oxygen present in humid air reacts with iron grains in the rocks to form a yellow or red oxide of iron.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0332	This is called rusting of the iron.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0333	Rust decomposes rocks completely with passage of time.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0334	This is the process by which various types of carbonates are formed.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0335	Some of these carbonates are soluble in water.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0336a	For example , when rain water containing carbon dioxide passes through pervious limestone rocks																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0336b	, the rock joints enlarge due to the action of carbonic acid.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0337	The joints enlarge in size.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0338	And lime is removed in solution.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0339	This type of breakdown of rocks is called carbonation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0340	This is the process by which water is absorbed by the minerals of the rock.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0341a	Due to the absorption of water by the rock , its volume increases																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0341b	and the grains lose their shape.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0342	Feldspar , for example , is changed into kaolin through hydration.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0343	Kaolin on Vindhyan Hills near Jabalpur has been formed in this manner.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0344	This is the process in which some of the minerals get dissolved in water.

Geo_nios_2ch_0354	The roots of the plants penetrate into the joints of the rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0355	They grow longer and thicker. .																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0356a	In this manner they exert pressure on the rocks																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0356b	and the rock joints are thereby enlarged																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0356c	and break into smaller fragments.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0357	Burrowing animals like earthworms , rats , rabbits , termites and ants breakdown the rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0358a	These disintegrated rocks can easily be eroded																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0358b	or removed by wind etc.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0359a	Hooves of animals break the soil																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0359b	and thus assist soil erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0360	The role of earthworms and termites is of special significance.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0361	According to scientists , there is a possibility of occurrence of about 1 , 50 , 000 earthworms in an acre. Human beings play a very important role in weathering of various rocks.

Geo_nios_2ch_0362b	and bring it to the surface.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0363	Human beings play a very important role in weathering of various rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0364	Man breaks a large amount of rocks in the course of his activities , like agriculture , construction of houses , roads etc.

Geo_nios_2ch_0393	It is called degradation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0394a	first of all includes the work of weathering.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0394b	that is the movement of scarped and scratched material aided by the great force of gravity.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0395a	It also includes the work of erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0395b	implying the transportation of the rock material by an agent of gradation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0396	The increase in the movement of rock - debris increases both its erosional and transportational capacities.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0397	Filling up of low-lying areas of depression by eroded material is called deposition.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0398a	Deposition starts.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0398b	when the agents of gradation lose their force.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0398c	or have obstruction in their way.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0399	As a result eroded material is deposited in depressions.

Geo_nios_2ch_0420a	The five factors are parent rock , relief , time , climate and plant and animal organisms.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0420b	which control the formation of soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0421a	The former three are called the passive factors.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0421b	while the later two are the active factors.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0422a	The parent material and climate are the most important.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0422b	because these two affect the other factors.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0423a	A soil is derived from the underlying rock.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0423b	or the parent rock material containing different minerals.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0424a	The parent rock gets broken into tiny pieces.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0424b	and is decomposed slowly by physical and , chemical weathering.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0425	It furnishes inorganic mineral particles of the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0426	The parent rock also influences the rate of soil formation , the chemical composition , colour , texture , structure , mineral content and fertility.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0427a	Topography of an area affects the degree of erosion of the parent rock material and the rate of surface run off of water.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0427b	Steep slopes aresubjected to more rapid run-off of surface water than the gentle slopes.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0428a	Thus , the relief affects directly and indirectly.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0428b	the processes involved in soil formation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0429a	Therefore , there is less infiltration of water on steeper slopes.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0429b	which retards soil forming processes.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0430	In addition , rapid run-off on steep slopes often erodes their surface faster than soil can develop.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0431a	It is because of this.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0431b	that the mountainous topography develops coarse , thin and infertile soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0432	Plain areas have rich well developed fertile soils.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0433	The soil forming process is very slow.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0434	A well developed soil results as an end product of physical , chemical and biological processes operating collectively for a very long period of time.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0435a	It is by far the most important factor in this sense.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0435b	over a long period of time it not only tends to reduce the difference caused by the parent material.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0435c	but also influences biological activities within the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0436	Due to this factor two different parent materials may develop the same type of soil in one type of climatic region.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0437	For example , granite and sandstone have developed into sandy soil in dry Rajasthan desert.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0438	On the other hand , two different types of soils may develop from the same parent material in two climatic regions.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0439	For example , the crystalline granites have developed laterite soils in monsoon regions and non laterite soils in sub humid regions.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0440	The process of weathering , its effectiveness and the type of plant and animal organisms in a region are directly linked with the seasonal change of temperature and distribution and nature of precipitation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0441	Hence , climate plays an important role in soil forming processes.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0442	Plants and animals play an active role in transforming parent materials into a mature soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0443	Dead plants and animals contribute to the organic content of the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0444	The process of decay , added by bacterial action , transforms organic matter into humus.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0445	Humus is responsible for the fertility of the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0446	It also enhances water retention capacity of the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0447	This organic material helps the soil to support plant life.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0448	The plant cover in turn protects rich upper layer of the soil from erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0449a	By increasing the proportion of rainfall entering into the soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0449b	rather than running off the surface.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0450	It also prevents greater evaporation of soil moisture by its thick canopy ,.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0451a	thus allowing soil to mature.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0451b	and become fertile.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0452	The climate , plant and animal organisms are the active factors of soil formation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0453	The parent material , relief and time are the passive factors of soil formation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0454	Soil profile is the arrangement of the soil into layer like horizons.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0455	These are physically , chemically and biologically different from each other.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0456a	Winds carry away vast quantity of fine soil particles and sand from deserts.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0456b	and spread it over adjoining cultivated land.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0457	This type of land destroy their fertility.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0458	This type of erosion is known as wind erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0459	It takes place in and around all desert regions of the world.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0460	In India , over one lakh kilometers of land is under Thar Desert.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0461	It spread over parts of Gujarat , Haryana , Punjab and Rajasthan states.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0462	These areas are subject to intense wind erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0463a	Water takes away thin layers of soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0463b	when moves as a sheet.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0464	This type of erosion is called sheet erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0465a	Such type of erosion is most common along the river beds.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0465b	and areas affected by floods.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0466a	In the long run , the soil is completely exhausted due to removal of top soil.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0466b	and becomes infertile.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0467	The removal of surface material usually soil , by the action of running water.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0468	The processes create numerous tiny channels ( rills ) a few centimeters in depth.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0469	The removal of soil material naturally or by human action is called soil erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0470	Soil erosion is of four types : wind erosion , sheet erosion , rill erosion , gully erosion.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0471	Factors influencing soil erosion are velocity and amount of surface run off , nature of slope , texture and structure of soils and frequency and speed of winds.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0472	Soil conservation methods include protection of forests , afforestation , bunding , reclamation of lands ; controlling floods , over grazing ; terracing , strip farming , contour ploughing and crop rotation.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0473	Earth is a spherical body.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0474	The direct observations into its interior are limited to a depth of a few kilometers.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0475	Temperature , pressure and density increase from the earth’s surface to its centre.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0476	Earth’s interior is divided into three concentric layers ; Crust , mantle and core.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0477	The material of the crust is composed of rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0478	Rock is composed of one or more minerals.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0479	Minerals have a definite chemical composition.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0480a	On the basis of their mode of formation , rocks are classified into three types - igneous , sedimentary and metamorphic.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0480b	Igneous rocks are formed by the solidification of molten lava or magma.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0481	Granite , basalt and gabbro are examples of igneous rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0482	Molten material solidified beneath the earth’s surface to form intrusive and above the earth surface to form extrusive igneous rocks.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0483a	They provide precious metals and stones , building material and fuel etc.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0483b	for our use.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0484	Rocks are of immense use to us.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0485	Soil erosion is a natural process of destruction and removal of soil material from its place.																								
Geo_nios_2ch_0486	Running water , winds , sea waves and glaciers are the most active agents of erosion.
