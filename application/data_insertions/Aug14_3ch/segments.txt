Geo_nios_3ch_0001a	In the previous lesson , we have learnt that this.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0001b	the interior of the earth is very hot.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0002	Earthquakes and volcanoes are concentrated along a few narrow belts.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0003	The type and density of rocks of the crust are variable.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0004	The surface features are dynamic in character.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0005	This dynamism is due to two forces — endogenetic and exogenetic.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0006	Endogenetic forces are those which are caused from below the surface.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0007a	Due to this , an area may get elevated.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0007b	Or it gets submerged.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0008	These forces try to make the surface irregular .																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0009	Exogenetic forces are those which operate from above the surface.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0010a	They try to eliminate the irregularities of the surface through the process of denudation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0010b	We will be reading in lesson.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0011	In this lesson we will be studying about the endogenetic forces.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0012	After studying this lesson , you will be able to define isostasy.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0013	After studying this lesson , you will be able to describe the variation in relief features on the earth’s surface.

Geo_nios_3ch_0015a	After studying this lesson , you will be able to explain the views of Airy and Pratt.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0015b	And distinguish between the ideas of both.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0016	After studying this lesson , you will be able to explain the concept of continental drift.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0017	After studying this lesson , you will be able to enumerate the evidences of continental drift.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0018	After studying this lesson , you will be able to explain the concept of plate tectonics.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0019a	After studying this lesson , you will be able to identify  different plates on the world map.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0019b	And locate them.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0020	After studying this lesson , you will be able to explain the mechanism of plate movement.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0021	After studying this lesson , you will be able to identify various plate boundaries and associated features.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0022	After studying this lesson , you will be able to explain the distribution of land and water on the globe.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0023	After studying this lesson , you will be able to associate earthquakes and volcanoes with plate boundaries.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0024a	The term “Isostasy” is derived from “Isostasia”.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0024b	It is  a word of Greek language meaning the state of being in balance.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0025	You already know and must have seen that the mountain have many peaks and relatively great heights.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0026	Similarly plateau and plain have flat surfaces.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0027a	They have moderate and lower height , respectively.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0027b	On the contrary oceanic beds and trenches have greater depths.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0028	There is a great difference in height among these features.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0029	You also know that the earth is rotating while keeping perfect balance among its various features.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0030	Thus , our earth is considered to be in isostatic equilibrium.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0031a	Example : - Suppose this																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0031b	You are holding one stick each in your both hands vertically with varying heights , say 5’ and 15’																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0031c	And  you are moving in a particular direction.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0032	Do you have any difficulty in maintaining a balance in congruence with your body as well as two sticks together ?.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0033	Definitely , smaller stick will be easy to make a balance than the longer one.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0034	It is just because of the center of gravity.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0035	The center of gravity with smaller stick will be nearer to your holding hand in comparison to the longer stick.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0036	In the same way smaller surface features like plains are more stable than the tall mountains.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0037	Isosatic Balance : views of Airy.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0038	Airy , a geologist , considered the density of different columns ( plains , plateaus , mountains , etc. ) to be the same.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0039	Hence , he proposed the idea of ‘uniform density with varying thickness’.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0040	We know that the upper crust of the earth is made up of lighter material.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0041a	In this layer , silica and aluminum are found in abundance.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0041b	hence it is known as ‘Sial’.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0042	It is less denser than the lower one.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0043a	Airy assumed this.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0043b	the Sialic crust is floating over the Sima ( silica and magnesium , lower denser layer ) .																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0044	Crustal layer is uniform in terms of density with varying length of columns.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0045	Therefore , those columns are projecting down into the asthenosphere depending upon the proportions of the column.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0046a	It is due to this reason that the root has developed.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0046b	or the sima has been displaced from below.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0047a	To prove this concept , Airy took an example of wooden blocks of various sizes and immersed them into water.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0047b	and immersed them into water.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0048	All blocks are of same density.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0049	They get immersed differently in proportion to their sizes.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0050a	In the same way higher features with great height seen on the surface of the earth have deeper roots.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0050b	whereas short in length has shorter roots beneath.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0051a	It is the concept of root.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0051b	which is sustaining the higher elevation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0052	He is of the opinion that the landmasses are floating like a boat in the substratum ( magmatic asthenosphere ) .																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0053	According to this concept , the root beneath the Mt. Everest would be 70 , 784 metre below the sea level.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0054	On this bases Airy has been criticized that the root is not possible to be at such a great depth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0055	Because the root material will melt due to higher temperature found at that depth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0056	Pratt considered landblocks of various heights to be different in terms of their density.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0057	The taller landmass has lesser density and smaller height features to be denser.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0058	In other words , there is an inverse relationship between height and density.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0059a	There is a higher column																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0059b	density will be lesser.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0059c	There is a shorter column																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0059d	density will be higher.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0060a	Assuming this to be true , he accepted this.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0060b	that all blocks of different height get compensated at a certain depth into the substratum.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0061	In this way a line is being demarcated above which there is equal pressure with varying heights.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0062a	Thus , he denounced the root concept of Airy.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0062b	And accepted the ‘concept of a level of compensation’.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0063a	For proving his concept he took a number of metal bars of varying density with same weight and put them into mercury.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0063b	And put them into mercury.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0064a	In this way they form a line by all those bars , which he regarded to be the level of compensation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0064b	Which he regarded to be the level of compensation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0065	Differences between the views of Airy and Pratt.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0066	The differences between the views of Airy and Pratt can more clearly be presented in a tabular form.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0067	Uniform density of crustal material.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0068	Varying density of crustal material.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0069	Varying depth upto which root penetrates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0070	Uniform depth upto which crustal material reaches.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0071	Deeper root below the mountain and smaller beneath plain.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0072	No root formation , but a level of compensation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0073	It is quite apparent that there is no complete isostatic balance over the globe.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0074	The earth is unstable.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0075	Endogenetic forces often disturb the crustal balance.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0076a	The regular earthquakes and volcanic eruptions along a particular belt do not signify any balance.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0076b	but a sort of adjustment is needed continuously.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0077a	Endogenetic forces and their tectonic effects are the causes of imbalance on the surface.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0077b	But nature always tries to make an isostatic adjustment with itself.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0078a	Exogenetic forces are trying to eliminate the differences on the surface of the earth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0078b	And in this process they are peeling off , transporting down to far flung places , and depositing them.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0079	In this process , isostatic balance is maintained by the underneath flowage of material by subsidence at the place of deposition and upliftment at the peeling of place in their proportion to the denudation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0080	According to Alfred Wegener , the entire landmass of the globe was together about 280 million years ago.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0081	It was termed as Pangea , a super continent.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0082	The huge water body surrounding the Pangea was known as Panthalasa.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0083a	From 280 to 150 million years ago , Pangea was broken latitudinally into northern and southern parts known as Laurasia ( Angaraland ) and Gondwanaland , respectively.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0083b	Known as Laurasia ( Angaraland ) and Gondwanaland , respectively.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0084a	Both of them drifted away																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0084b	and in between a shallow sea emerged by filling up the water from Panthalasa.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0084c	It was known as Tethys sea.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0085a	Later on Laurasia and Gondwanaland rifted.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0085b	And finally drifted to form the present day distribution of land and water on the eart.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0086	Wegener gave a number of evidences in support of the unification of land mass in geologic past.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0087	They are such which cannot be negated even today.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0088a	Eastern coast of South America is identical to Western coast of Africa which fits to a certain depth in the ocean.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0088b	Which fits to a certain depth in the ocean.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0089	To a certain extent coastal areas and continental shelves have been modified by oceanic waves through denudation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0090	The mountain systems of Southern Atlantic coast in South America and Africa show the similarity of the extension in both continents.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0091	Coal and Vegetation evidences.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0092	The distribution of coal and vegetation over South America , Africa , India and Australia proves that they were together in geological past.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0093a	The classical glacial deposits during carboniferous period over these landmasses resemble each other which tells the story of togetherness.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0093b	Which tells the story of togetherness.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0094	Today they lie in different climatic zones.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0095a	Apart from above evidences put forward by Wegener , other evidences ( known later ) are also there.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0095b	which support the idea of continental drift.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0096	Paleomagnetism is the study of the direction of pole through ages.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0097a	Magnetically susceptible minerals like haematite , pyrrhotite magnetite etc. get aligned with the magnetic pole of the earth and recorded in the solidification of magma during that time.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0097b	And recorded in the solidification of magma during that time.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0098a	It is found that periodic changes have occurred.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0098b	And poles have wandered which is not possible for the entire earth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0099a	Hence , it is the twist and turn of the landblock.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0099b	And not for the entire earth which has again explained that the continents have shifted their positions.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0100a	Along the mid Atlantic ridge , magma comes out at the sea bed and gets solidified.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0100b	And gets solidified.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0101a	A new zone is formed and this process is continuing since millions of years.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0101b	And this process is continuing since millions of years.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0102a	It is leading for diversion of continental block																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0102b	the size of the Atlantic ocean is increasing which is termed as sea floor spreading.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0103	It is the classical example of the shifting of continents.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0104	The explanation of continental drift through sea floor spreading and the study of paleomagnetism is commonly known as Plate Tectonics.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0105	The uppermost outer solid and rigid layer of the earth is called crust.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0106	Its thickness varies considerably.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0107a	It is as little as 5 km thick beneath the oceans at some places																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0107b	but under some mountain ranges it extends upto a depth of 70 km.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0108	Below the crust denser rocks are found , known as mantle crust.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0109	This upper part of mantle upto an average depth of 100 km from the surface is solid.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0110	This solid mantle plus upper crust form a comparatively rigid block termed as lithosphere.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0111	Mantle is partially molten between 100 to 250 km depth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0112	This zone is said to be asthenosphere ,.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0113a	This Zone is also known as Mohr discontinuity																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0113b	a simplification of Mohorovicic , the name of the seismologist who discovered it.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0114	All these things you have already read in the previous lesson.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0115	The lithosphere is broken into several blocks.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0116	These blocks are known as plates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0117	which are moving over asthenosphere.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0118	There are seven major plates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0119	Apart from these major plates minor plates are about 20 in number.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0120	a few important among them are.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0121	Arabian plate , Philippine plate , Cocos plate , Nazca plate , Caribbean plate , Scotia plate , etc.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0122	The major and minor plates constitute the whole surface of the earth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0123	Plate tectonics is a method or way of understanding the land-water distribution of the earth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0124	Tectonics is a sort of movement of plates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0125	Through the movement , internal forces are explained which are responsible for the distribution of earth’s crust , formation of mountain chains and distribtion of earthquakes and volcanism.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0126a	Arthur Holmes , a British geologist , in 1928 – 1929 , proposed																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0126b	convectional currents exist underneath the lithosphere.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0127a	The center of convectional current is not exactly known																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0127b	it is believed																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0127c	that it has an average depth of about 100 to 250 km below the surface.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0128	The inception of the current is initiated by heat generation due to radio-active minerals.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0129a	Due to integration and disintegration of atomic minerals heat is produced																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0129b	the melting of surrounding rocks.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0130	In this way currents start operating.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0131	These currents are classified into rising and falling with divergence and convergence activities , respectively.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0132	With rising convectional current , transport of hot and viscous matter takes place upwardly.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0133	After reaching about 100 kms below the surface that current gets diverged leading to split into the upper part.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0134	The molten material penetrates into the split and thus creation of new surface and the draft of the mammoth plate in opposition direction.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0135	It happens below the mid-oceanic ridge.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0136a	On the other hand two sets of diverging thermal convectional currents brings two plates together																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0136b	It is called convergent boundary where subduction takes place.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0137	Plates of lithosphere are constantly in motion because of convectional currents.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0138	Plate boundaries are very important and significant structural features.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0139	Boundaries are very distinct and easy to identify.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0140	They are associated with newly formed mountain systems , oceanic ridges and trenches.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0141a	Plates are moving continuously.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0141b	Plates have relative direction of movement.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0142	Based on the direction of movement three types of plate boundaries can , easily , be identified.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0143	The convectional current are caused due to radio-activity.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0144	These currents get diverted on approaching the crust layer.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0145	Diverging currents produce tension at the contact-zone of crust leading to fracture.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0146a	Magnetic material penetrates into the fractroges																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0146b	It gets solidified.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0147a	This continuous process pushes the blocks in opposite direction.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0147b	It creates a new zone , known as “zone of construction”.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0148	At convergent boundary , two adjacent plates come further and further closer to each other and collide.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0149a	When both sides are of continental nature																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0149b	a mountain formation is evident.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0150	When one of the two is continental and the other maritime again mountain comes into being along the boundary.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0151	In this case , continental plate overrides the maritime.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0152a	When both plates are of maritime , both of them break , subduct and penetrate below.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0152b	hence trenches are formed.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0153	Along this boundary earthquakes and volcanic activities are prominent.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0154a	In all these three situations , surface area is reduced																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0154b	therefore , this is also known as “zone of destruction”.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0155	Transform fault is the one when two adjacent plates slide past each other.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0156a	Direction of movement may be along or against.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0156b	They move parallel to each other.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0157	Therefore , neither there is any construction of fresh area nor it has any destruction.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0158	Hence , it is known as “zone of preservation”.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0159a	Plates are not a permanent features																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0159b	but they vary in size and shape.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0160	Plates can split or get welded with adjoining plate.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0161	Almost all tectonic activities occur along the plate boundaries.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0162	Prior to the advent of plate tectonic theory , the continental drift theory which was proposed by Wegener was criticized , particularly about the forces.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0163	In fact , it was outrightly rejected in spite of apparent evidences.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0164a	But further researches about the material of sea floor and paleomagnetism supported the theory																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0164b	the proposition of plate tectonic theory in 1960’s has solved the problem of the mechanism of movement.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0165	Plate Tectonics Vs Earthquakes and Volcanoes.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0166	The distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes over the globe clearly reveals that they are strongly associated with the boundaries of plates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0167	Plate boundaries are the zones where every sort of tectonic activity does take place.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0168	The release of energy created because of the movement of plates is manifested in this zone in the form of earthquakes and volcanic eruption.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0169	What you have learnt ?.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0170	The surface of the earth is dynamic.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0171	This dynamism is due to the forces operating from inside the surface ( endogenetic forces ) as well as on the surface / atmospheric forces ( exogenetic forces ) .																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0172	It is existing on the earth while itself is rotating and revolving.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0173	The surface is irregular.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0174a	Hence , a sort of dynamic equilibrium is always in operation.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0174b	A sort of dynamic equilibrium is termed as isostasy.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0175	Apart from many scholars the views of Airy and Pratt are more distinct.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0176	Airy propounded the idea of uniform density of all rocks on the surface.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0177	has its roots depending upon the height of the column.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0178	A greater root will be found beneath the higher and lofy body of mountains and having smaller root under lower columns like plateau or plain.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0179	Pratt accepted that the rocks found on the earth have different densities.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0180	At a particulars depth , the weight of all columns of varying height will be compensated.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0181a	Hence , higher column of mass will have lower density.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0181b	lower column will have higher density.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0182	Therefore , both of them are explaining the same problem of isostatic balance , but with different perspective.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0183	The distribution of land and water on earth surface is not static.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0184a	It has changed																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0184b	It is changing.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0184c	It will change in future too.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0185a	This changed position is said to be continental drift in crude way which was conceived by Wegener																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0185b	The mechanism explained by him was not scientific.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0186a	Therefore , his ideas of continental drift was denounced.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0186b	in spite of his strong futile and testifying evidences.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0187	With the concept of convectional current theory of Holmes and proposition of plate tectonics , a new thinking came in understanding the surface of the earth.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0188	Study on paleomagnetism as well as sea floor spreading have supported the plate tectonics theory.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0189	According to this theory , the earth surface is made up of several broken blocks of enormous size with great depth considered to be a plate.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0190	There are seven bigger size plates and twenty seven smaller size plates.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0191	As per the concept of convectional current , their movement takes place in three possible ways.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0192	First , two adjacent plates move away ( divergent ) and where a new zone is constructed.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0193	Second , two adjacent plates come closer ( convergent ) and get subducted and where a zone is destroyed.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0194a	Third , in which two adjacent plates slide past each other ( fracture )																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0194b	the margins of both plates are preserved.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0195	Because of these different tectonic activities , earthquakes and volcanoes are associated with plate margins.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0196	What is isostasy ?.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0197	Explain the concept of isostasy according to Airy.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0198	Explain the isostatic balance of the earth as proposed by Pratt.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0199	Differentiate the ideas between Airy and Pratt.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0200	Discuss the isostatic balance at global level.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0201	Discuss the evidences of continental drift.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0202	What is plate ?.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0203	Explain the mechanism of plate movement.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0204	Discuss the activities at plate margins.																								
Geo_nios_3ch_0205	Describe the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes with the help of plate boundaries.
