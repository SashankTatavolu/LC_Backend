An easy-to-cure disease is one during which the patient is able to tolerate all therapeutic techniques. The patient has to be strong, in control of his sense organs, the disease must not be at a marma point, the disease symptoms must be in the initial phase and they must be scarce, of a minor nature, and without complications. The disease must be in harmony with theTridosha, the climate, the season and the body type. All four factors of treatment must be present. According to astrology, the planets must be in a favourable position. The diasease must be due to only oneDosha, one type of directional force, and it must be new (not chronic). These are the factors of easy-to-cure diseases.
