The ascetic V훮lm카ki put the following question direct to n훮rada, the chief of hermits, the foremost of those skilled in expression, who remains (ever) engaged in penance and self-study (the study of the Vedas and Ved훮ngas).    Who can possibly be full of virtues in this world at present?    Who is possessed of prowess and knows what is right? Who is conscious of services done, truthful of speech and firm of resolve?    Who is possesssed of right conduct?    Who is friendly to all living beings?    Who is a man of knowledge?    Who is powerful?    Who has a singularly lovable appearance?    Who has subdued his self?    Who has conquered anger and who is possessed of spledour ?    Who is above fault finding?    Who do the gods dread when his wrath has been (apparently) provoked in battle?    I wish to hear this.    for there is a great curiousity in my mind about such a person.    O eminent seer ! While you are capable of knowing such a man.
