We live on an unstable earth with uneven surface featuring diverse landforms like mountains, hills, plateaus and plains. The deformation of originally horizontal rock layers into tilted, folded and faulted structures results from continuous action of internal (endogenetic) and external (exogenetic) forces. Endogenetic forces derive energy from earth's internal heat and chemical reactions, causing vertical and horizontal movements that create primary landforms.
Earth movements are classified as sudden (earthquakes, volcanoes) or slow (epirogenic, orogenic). Slow vertical movements cause continental uplift/subsidence while horizontal movements produce folding and faulting. Folding occurs when compressional forces bend rock layers, forming anticlines (upfolds) and synclines (downfolds). Extreme folding creates fold mountains like Himalayas. Faulting happens when rocks fracture under tension or compression, producing faults (normal, reverse, strike-slip) and landforms like rift valleys (grabens) and block mountains (horsts).
Volcanoes occur where magma from earth's interior erupts through vents. Types include: active (frequent eruptions like Mt. Etna); dormant (long inactive but may erupt); and extinct (no eruption records). Volcanic forms are shield (fluid lava, gentle slopes), cinder cone (steep conical) and composite (alternate lava/ash layers). Major volcanic zones coincide with plate boundaries, especially the Pacific Ring of Fire. Positive effects include fertile soils and geothermal energy while negatives are destruction and climate impact.
Earthquakes result from sudden crustal movements along faults, with focus (origin point) and epicenter (surface point above focus). Seismic waves (P, S, L) are recorded by seismographs. The Richter scale measures magnitude while Mercalli scale assesses intensity. Earthquake distribution matches plate boundaries, with most in the Circum-Pacific and Alpine-Himalayan belts. Effects include ground shaking, tsunamis, landslides and infrastructure damage. Prediction remains challenging but construction improvements can mitigate risks.
The interaction of endogenetic and exogenetic forces creates the dynamic landscape we observe. While internal forces build relief through uplift and deformation, external processes continuously wear it down through weathering and erosion, maintaining earth's topographic diversity.
